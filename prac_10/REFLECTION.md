# Practical 10 – Reflection

## What have you learned well in this subject?
- Writing clean, modular Python with SRP and small functions.
- Using version control properly: branches, PRs, and code reviews.
- Building and extending classes (inheritance, composition), plus testing with asserts and doctests.

## What do you still need to work on?
- More practice with GUIs (Kivy) and Flask templating (Jinja).
- Designing tests first (TDD mindset) instead of after coding.

## What parts of the practicals did you enjoy or find most valuable?
- Refactoring and seeing tests catch regressions.
- Connecting to external APIs (Wikipedia) and turning scripts into small web apps with Flask.

## How will you apply these skills in future work/study?
- Keep a branch-per-task workflow and request/perform reviews.
- Always write doctests/examples for utility functions.
- Reuse core logic across Console, GUI, and Web front‑ends.
