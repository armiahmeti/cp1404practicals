# CP1404 Practicals – Armi Ahmeti
## Clean Code, OOP, and Consistent Version Control

This repo contains my CP1404 practical work. It’s structured by `prac_xx` folders and worked on using **feature branches** + **Pull Requests** with code reviews.

### About Me
- Bachelor of IT student focused on software engineering and automation.
- I work in branches, open PRs, request & provide reviews, and merge via GitHub.

### Three (plus) clean-code lessons I’ve learned
- **Small, focused functions** – follow SRP; one reason to change.
- **Good names > comments** – clear intent with nouns/verbs, avoid noise.
- **Immutable constants & config at the top** – easier tuning and fewer magic numbers.
- **Iterative development** – commit in small steps; review diffs often.
- **Docstrings & typing** – describe behaviour and data, not the obvious.

> Tip: Use *Reformat Code* and run linters before committing.
